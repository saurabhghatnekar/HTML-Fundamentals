<h2>About</h2>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>
    Pune is the 9th most populous city in India and the second largest in the state of Maharashtra after the state
    capital Mumbai. Pune is also the 101st largest city in the world, by population. The city is also known for various
    cultural activities like classical music, spirituality, theatre, sports, and literature. These activities and job
    opportunities attract migrants and students from all over India and abroad, which makes for a city of many
    communities and cultures.

<h3>Weather</h3>
<p>
    Pune experiences three seasons: summer, monsoon, and winter. Typical summer months are from March to May, with
    maximum temperatures ranging from 30 to 38 °C (86 to 100 °F). The warmest month in Pune is April; although summer
    doesn't end until May, the city often receives heavy thundershowers in May (and humidity remains high). Even during
    the hottest months, the nights are usually cool due to Pune's high altitude.
