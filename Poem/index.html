<h1>My Poem</h1>

<p>I'm Nobody! Who are you?<br>
    Are you - Nobody - Too? <br>
    Then there's a pair of us!<br>
    Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!
</p>
<p>
    How dreary - to be - Somebody! <br>

    How public - like a Frog - <br>

    To tell one's name - the livelong June - To an admiring Bog! <br>
</p>
<p>
    <em>By Emily Dickinson (1891)</em>
